        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>This recipe website is a starter project created as part of the Google Student Training in Engineering Program in Summer 2020. <br></br>In lieu of a portfolio page, I am making a simple recipe website to share amongst family and friends. This project is done in loving memory of my wonderful nanny Vera Merle Bulger (Feb 1930 - May 2020) who, before her passing, was working hard to copy her recipes by hand to give everyone to keep and enjoy. She was never able to complete her project, so I hope that by creating this site I can share some of her favourite recipes with everyone as she had hoped to do. Once this page is up and active, I invite family and friends to contribute new recipes that they've discovered over the years!<br></br>Hope you enjoy!<br></br>-Miasya
